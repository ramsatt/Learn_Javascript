<h2>Java - What is OOP?</h2>
<p>OOP stands for <strong>Object-Oriented Programming</strong>.</p>

<p>Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform 
operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about 
creating objects that contain both data and methods.</p>
<p>Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural 
programming:</p>
<ul>
  <li>OOP is faster and easier to execute</li>
  <li>OOP provides a clear structure for the programs</li>
  <li>OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY &quot;Don't Repeat Yourself&quot;, and makes 
  the 
  code easier to maintain, modify and debug</li>
  <li>OOP makes it possible to create full reusable 
  applications with less code and shorter development time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> The &quot;Don't Repeat Yourself&quot; (DRY) principle is about 
reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are 
common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them 
instead of repeating it.</p>

<h2>Java - What are Classes and Objects?</h2>
<p>Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.</p>
<p>Look at the following illustration to see the difference between class and 
objects:</p>

<div class="flex-container">
  <div class="box">
    <h2>class</h2>  
    <p>Fruit</p>
  </div>
  <div class="box">
    <h2>objects</h2>  
    <p>Apple</p>
    <p>Banana</p>
    <p>Mango</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Another example:</p>
<div class="flex-container">
  <div class="box">
    <h2>class</h2>  
    <p>Car</p>
  </div>
  <div class="box">
    <h2>objects</h2>  
    <p>Volvo</p>
    <p>Audi</p>
    <p>Toyota</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.</p>
<p>When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the 
variables and methods from the class.</p>
