<h2>Get Started With C</h2>
<p>At W3Schools, you can start learning C without installing anything.</p>

<p>Our Online C Editor runs directly in your browser and shows both the code and the result:</p>

<div class="w3-example">
<p>Code:</p>
<div class="w3-code notranslate javaHigh">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br><br>int main() {<br>&nbsp; printf(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);<br>&nbsp; 
  return 0;<br>}</div>
<p>Result:</p>
<div class="notranslate w3-black w3-padding">
  <code>
  Hello World!</code>
</div>

</div>

<p>This editor will be used in the entire tutorial to demonstrate the different aspects of C.</p>

<h2>Install C</h2>
<p>If you want to run C programs on your own computer, you need two things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A text editor to write C code</li>
  <li>A compiler to turn the C code into a program the computer can run</li>
</ul>

<p>The compiler reads your C code and translates it into machine code.</p>

<p>There are many editors and compilers available. To make things easier, most people use an <strong><i>IDE</i></strong>, which includes both.</p>

<h2>Install IDE</h2>
<p>An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a program that helps you write, compile, and run code.</p>

<p>Popular IDEs include Code::Blocks, Eclipse, and Visual Studio. These are free tools that can also help you find errors in your code.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Web-based IDEs can also work, but they often have limited features.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will use <strong>Code::Blocks</strong>, which is a good and simple choice for beginners.</p>

<p>You can download Code::Blocks from <a href="https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries/" target="_blank">https://www.codeblocks.org</a>.
Choose the <code class="w3-codespan">mingw-setup.exe</code> file, which includes both the editor and a compiler.</p>

<h2>C Quickstart</h2>
<p>Let's create our first C file.</p>
<p>Open Codeblocks and go to <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Empty File</strong>.</p>
<p>Write the following C code and save the file as <code class="w3-codespan">
myfirstprogram.c</code> (<strong>File &gt; Save File as</strong>):</p>
<div class="w3-example">
<h4>myfirstprogram.c</h4>
<div class="w3-code notranslate javaHigh">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br><br>int main() {<br>&nbsp; printf(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);<br>&nbsp; 
  return 0;<br>}</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> C source files always end with <code class="w3-codespan">.c</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Don't worry</strong> if you don't understand the code above - we will discuss it in detail in later chapters. For now, focus on how to run the code.</p>

<p>In Codeblocks, it should look like this:</p>
<img src="assets/content/images/codeblocks2020.png" style="width:100%;max-width:800px" class="w3-border">
<p>Then, go to <strong>Build &gt; Build and Run</strong> to run (execute) the program. The result will look something to this:</p>

<div class="w3-example w3-padding-16">
<div class="notranslate w3-black w3-padding">
  <code>
  Hello World!<br>Process returned 0 (0x0) execution time : 0.011 s<br>Press any 
  key to continue.</code>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you see the message above, your setup is working correctly.</p>

<p><strong>Congratulations</strong>! You have now written and executed your first C program.</p>


<div class="w3-panel ws-note">
<p><strong>What just happened?</strong> You wrote C code, the compiler turned it into a program, and the computer ran it. This is the basic workflow you will use throughout this tutorial.</p>
