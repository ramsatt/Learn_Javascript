  <p>TypeScript is JavaScript with added syntax for types.</p>

<h2>What is TypeScript?</h2>

<p>TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds <strong>static typing</strong>.</p>
<p>This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add <strong>types</strong>.</p>

<div class="w3-panel ws-note">
  <p>TypeScript being a <strong>Syntactic Superset</strong> means it shares the same base syntax as JavaScript, but adds something to it.</p>

<h2>Why should I use TypeScript?</h2>

<p>JavaScript is a loosely typed language.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to understand what types of data are being passed around in JavaScript.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, function parameters and variables don't have any information!</p>
<p>So developers need to look at documentation, or guess based on the implementation.</p>
<p>TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.</p>
<p>For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a string into a function that expects a number.</p>
<p>JavaScript will not.</p>

<div class="w3-panel ws-note">
  <p>TypeScript uses compile time type checking.</p>
  <p>Which means it checks if the specified types match <strong>before</strong> running the code, not <strong>while</strong> running the code.</p>
</div>

<h2>How do I use TypeScript?</h2>

<p>A common way to use TypeScript is to use the official TypeScript compiler, which transpiles TypeScript code into JavaScript.</p>
<p>The next section shows how to get the compiler setup for a local project.</p>
<p>Some popular code editors, such as Visual Studio Code, have built-in TypeScript support and can show errors as you write code!</p>
