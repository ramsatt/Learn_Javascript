<h1>TypeScript Casting</h1>



<hr>

<p>There are times when working with types where it's necessary to override the type of a variable, such as when incorrect types are provided by a library.</p>
<p>Casting is the process of overriding a type.</p>

<h2>Casting with <code class="w3-codespan">as</code></h2>

<p>
A straightforward way to cast a variable is using the <code class="w3-codespan">as</code> keyword,
which will directly change the type of the given variable.
</p>

<div class="w3-example">
<h3>Example</h3>

<div class="w3-code notranslate jsHigh">
let x: unknown = 'hello';<br>
console.log((x as string).length);<br>
</div>


</div>

<div class="w3-panel ws-info">
<p>
Casting doesn't actually change the type of the data within the variable,
for example the following code will not work as expected since the variable <code class="w3-codespan">x</code> still holds a number.<br>

<div class="w3-code notranslate jsHigh">
let x: unknown = 4;<br>
console.log((x as string).length); // prints undefined since numbers don't have a length
</div>
</p>
</div>

<div class="w3-panel ws-info">
<p>
TypeScript will still attempt to typecheck casts to prevent casts that don't seem correct,
for example the following will throw a type error since TypeScript knows casting a string to a number doesn't make sense
without converting the data:<br>

<div class="w3-code notranslate jsHigh">
console.log((4 as string).length); // Error: Conversion of type 'number' to type 'string' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
</div>
The Force casting section below covers how to override this.

<h2>Casting with <code class="w3-codespan">&lt;&gt;</code></h2>

<p>
Using &lt;&gt; works the same as casting with <code class="w3-codespan">as</code>.
</p>

<div class="w3-example">
<h3>Example</h3>

<div class="w3-code notranslate jsHigh">
let x: unknown = 'hello';<br>
console.log((&lt;string&gt;x).length);<br>
</div>


</div>

<div class="w3-panel ws-info">
<p>
This type of casting will not work with TSX, such as when working on React files.
</p>
</div>

<hr>
<h2>Force casting</h2>

<p>
To override type errors that TypeScript may throw when casting, first cast to <code class="w3-codespan">unknown</code>, then to the target type.
</p>

<div class="w3-example">
<h3>Example</h3>

<div class="w3-code notranslate jsHigh">
let x = 'hello';<br>
console.log(((x as unknown) as number).length); // x is not actually a number so this will return undefined
</div>


</div>
