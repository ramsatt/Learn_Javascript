<h2>Memory Address</h2>
<p>When a variable is created in C, a memory address is assigned to the variable.</p>
<p>The memory address is the 
location of where the variable is stored on the computer.
</p>
<p>When we assign a value to the variable, it is stored in this memory 
address. </p>
<p>To access it, use the reference 
operator (<code class="w3-codespan">&amp;</code>), and the result represents where the variable is stored:</p>
<div class="w3-example">
<h3>Example</h3>
<div class="w3-code notranslate javaHigh">
  int myAge = 43;<br>printf(&quot;%p&quot;, <strong>&amp;myAge</strong>); // Outputs 0x7ffe5367e044<br>
 </div>

</div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The memory address is in hexadecimal form (0x..). You 
will probably not get the same result in your program, as this depends on where 
the variable is stored on your computer.</p>
<p>You should also note that <code class="w3-codespan">&amp;myAge</code> is often called a "pointer". A pointer basically stores the memory address of a variable as its value. To print pointer values, 
we use the <code class="w3-codespan">%p</code> format specifier.</p>
<p>You will learn much more about 
<a href="c_pointers.html">pointers</a> in the next chapter.</p>

<h4>Why is it useful to know the memory address?</h4>
  <p><a href="c_pointers.html"><strong>Pointers</strong></a> are important in C, because they allow us to manipulate the data in the computer's memory - <strong>this can reduce the code and improve the performance</strong>.</p>
  <p>Pointers are one of the things that make C stand out from other 
  programming languages, like <a href="../python/default.html">Python</a> and <a href="../java/default.html">Java</a>.</p>
