<h2>How does React Work?</h2>

<div class="w3-panel ws-note">
<p>React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.</p>
</div>

<p>Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual 
DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the 
changes in the browser DOM.</p>
<div class="w3-panel ws-note">
<p>React only changes what needs to be changed!</p>
</div>
<p>React finds out what changes have been 
made, and changes <strong>only</strong> 
what needs to be changed. </p>

<p>You will learn the various aspects of how React does this in the rest of this 
tutorial.</p>
