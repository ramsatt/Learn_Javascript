<h2>HTML File Paths</h2>
<p>A file path describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure.</p>
<p>File paths are used when linking to external files, like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Web pages</li>
  <li>Images</li>
  <li>Style sheets</li>
  <li>JavaScripts</li>
</ul>

<h2>Absolute File Paths</h2>
<p>An absolute file path is the full URL to a file:</p>
<div class="w3-example">
<h3>Example</h3>
<div class="w3-code notranslate htmlHigh">
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg&quot; 
  alt=&quot;Mountain&quot;&gt;
</div>
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="w3-panel ws-note">
<p>The &lt;img&gt; tag is explained in the chapter: <a href="html_images.html">HTML Images</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Relative File Paths</h2>
<p>A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page.</p>
<p>In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located 
at the root of the current website:</p>
<div class="w3-example">
<h3>Example</h3>
<div class="w3-code notranslate htmlHigh">
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/picture.jpg&quot; 
alt=&quot;Mountain&quot;&gt;
</div>
<p></p>
</div>

<p>In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the 
current folder:</p>
<div class="w3-example">
<h3>Example</h3>
<div class="w3-code notranslate htmlHigh">
&lt;img src=&quot;images/picture.jpg&quot; 
alt=&quot;Mountain&quot;&gt;
</div>
<p>
</p>
</div>

<p>In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the 
folder one level up from the current folder:</p>
<div class="w3-example">
<h3>Example</h3>
<div class="w3-code notranslate htmlHigh">
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/picture.jpg&quot; 
alt=&quot;Mountain&quot;&gt;
</div>
<p>
</p>
</div>

<h2>Best Practice</h2>
<p>It is best practice to use relative file paths (if possible).</p>
<p>When using relative file paths, your web pages will not be bound to your current 
base URL. All links will work on your own computer (localhost) as well as on 
your current public domain and your future public domains.</p>
