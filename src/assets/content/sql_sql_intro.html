<h2>SQL is a Standard - BUT....</h2>
<p>Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.</p>
<p>However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as <code class="w3-codespan">
SELECT</code>, <code class="w3-codespan">UPDATE</code>, <code class="w3-codespan">
DELETE</code>, <code class="w3-codespan">INSERT</code>, <code class="w3-codespan">
WHERE</code>) in a similar manner.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard!</p>

<h2>Using SQL in Your Web Site</h2>
<p>To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)</li>
  <li>To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP</li>
  <li>To use SQL to get the data you want</li>
  <li>To use HTML / CSS to style the page</li>
</ul>

<h2>RDBMS</h2>
<p>RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.</p>
<p>RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.</p>
<p>The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.</p>
<p>Look at the &quot;Customers&quot; table:</p>

<div class="w3-example">
<h3>Example</h3>
<div class="w3-code notranslate sqlHigh">
SELECT * FROM Customers;
</div>

</div>

<p>Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields. The fields in 
the Customers table consist of CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, 
City, PostalCode and Country. A field is a column in a table that is designed to maintain 
specific information about every record in the table.</p>
<p>A record, also called a row, is each individual entry that exists in a table. 
For example, there are 91 records in the above Customers table. A record is a 
horizontal entity in a table.</p>
<p>A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information 
associated with a specific field in a table.</p>
