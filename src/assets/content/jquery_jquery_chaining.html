<h2>jQuery Method Chaining</h2>
<p>Until now we have been writing jQuery statements one at a time (one after the 
other).</p>
<p>However, there is a technique called chaining, that 
allows us to run multiple jQuery commands, one after the other, on the same 
element(s).</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> This way, browsers do not have to find the same element(s) more than once.</p>
<p>To chain 
an action, you simply append the action to the previous action. </p>
<p>The following example chains together the <code class="w3-codespan">css()</code>, <code class="w3-codespan">slideUp()</code>, and <code class="w3-codespan">slideDown()</code> 
methods. The &quot;p1&quot; element first changes to red, then it slides up, and then it 
slides down: </p>
<div class="w3-example">
<h3>Example</h3>
<div class="w3-code notranslate jsHigh">
$(&quot;#p1&quot;).css(&quot;color&quot;, &quot;red&quot;).slideUp(2000).slideDown(2000);</div>

</div>
<p>We could also have added more method calls if needed.</p>
<p><b>Tip</b>: When chaining, the line of code 
could become quite long. However, jQuery is not very strict on the syntax; you can format it like you want, including line breaks and indentations. </p>
<p>This also works just fine:</p>
<div class="w3-example">
<h3>Example</h3>
<div class="w3-code notranslate jsHigh">
$(&quot;#p1&quot;).css(&quot;color&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)<br>
&nbsp; .slideUp(2000)<br>
&nbsp; .slideDown(2000);</div>

</div>
<p>jQuery throws away extra whitespace and executes the lines above as one long line of code.</p>
