<h2>Adding jQuery to Your Web Pages</h2>
<p>There are several ways to start using jQuery on your web site. You can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Download the jQuery library from jQuery.com</li>
  <li>Include jQuery from a CDN, like Google</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>Downloading jQuery</h2>
<p>There are two versions of jQuery available for downloading: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Production version - this is for your live website because it has been minified and compressed</li>
  <li>Development version - this is for testing and development (uncompressed and readable code)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both versions can be downloaded from <a target="_blank" href="http://jquery.com/download/">jQuery.com</a>.</p>
<p>The jQuery library is a single JavaScript file, and you reference it with the HTML <code class="w3-codespan">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag 
(notice that the <code class="w3-codespan">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag should be inside the <code class="w3-codespan">&lt;head&gt;</code> section):</p>


<div class="w3-code w3-border notranslate htmlHigh"><div>
&lt;head&gt;<br>
&lt;script src=&quot;jquery-3.7.1.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br>
&lt;/head&gt;
</div></div>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Place the downloaded file in the same directory as the pages where you wish to use it.<br>
</p>
<hr>

<h2>jQuery CDN</h2>
<p>If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).</p>
<p>Google is an example of someone who host jQuery:</p>
<div class="w3-example">
<h3>Google CDN:</h3>
<div class="w3-code notranslate htmlHigh">
&lt;head&gt;<br>
 &lt;script src=&quot;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.7.1/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br>
&lt;/head&gt;
</div>

</div>

<div class="w3-panel ws-note">
<p><b>One big advantage of using the hosted jQuery from Google:</b><br><br>
Many users already have downloaded jQuery from Google when visiting 
another site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. 
Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it will be served 
from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.</p>
