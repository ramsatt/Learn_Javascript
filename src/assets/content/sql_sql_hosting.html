<h2>SQL Hosting</h2>
<p>If you want your web site to be able to store and retrieve data from a 
database, your web server should have access to a database-system that uses the 
SQL language.</p>
<p>If your web server is hosted by an Internet Service Provider (ISP), you will have to look for SQL hosting plans.</p>
<p>The most common SQL hosting databases are MS SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, and MS Access.</p>
<hr>
<h2>MS SQL Server</h2>
<p>Microsoft's SQL Server is a popular database software for  database-driven web sites 
with high traffic.</p>
<p>SQL Server is a very powerful, robust and full featured SQL database system.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Oracle</h2>
<p>Oracle is also a popular database software for  database-driven web sites 
with high traffic.</p>
<p>Oracle is a very powerful, robust and full featured SQL database system.</p>
<hr>
<h2>MySQL</h2>
<p>MySQL is also a popular database software for web sites.</p>

<p>MySQL is a very powerful, robust and full featured SQL database system.</p>

<p>MySQL is an inexpensive 
alternative to the expensive Microsoft and Oracle solutions.</p>

<hr>
<h2>MS Access</h2>
<p>When a web site requires only a simple database, Microsoft Access can be a 
solution.</p>
<p>MS Access is not well suited for very high-traffic, and not as powerful as 
MySQL, SQL Server, or Oracle.</p>
