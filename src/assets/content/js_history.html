<h2>JavaScript / ECMAScript</h2>
<p><b>JavaScript</b> was invented by <b>Brendan Eich</b> in 1995.</p>
<p>It was developed for <b>Netscape 2</b>, and became the <b>ECMA-262</b> standard in 1997.</p>
<p>After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation 
continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser.
Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5. (Identical to ES5).</p>
<p><b>Internet Explorer</b> (IE4) was the first browser to support ECMA-262 Edition 1 (ES1).</p>

<h2>The ECMA Technical Committee 39</h2>
<p>In 1996, Netscape and Brendan Eich took JavaScript to the ECMA international standards organization,
and a technical committee (TC39) was created to develop the language.</p>
<p>ECMA-262 Edition 1 was released in June 1997.</p>

<hr>
<h2>From ES4 to ES6</h2>
<p>When the TC39 committee got together in Oslo in 2008, to agree on ECMAScript 4, they were divided into
2 very different camps:
</p><p><b>The ECMAScript 3.1 Camp</b>:<br>
Microsoft and Yahoo who wanted an incremental upgrade from ES3.</p>
<p><b>The ECMAScript 4 Camp</b>:<br>
Adobe, Mozilla, Opera, and Google who wanted a massive ES4 upgrade.</p>
<p>August 13 2008, Brendan Eich wrote an
<a href="https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es-discuss/2008-August/006837.html">email</a>:</p>
<p class="w3-serif w3-large"><i>It's no secret that the JavaScript standards body, Ecma's Technical  
Committee 39, has been split for over a year, with some members  
favoring ES4, a major fourth edition to ECMA-262, and others  
advocating ES3.1 based on the existing ECMA-262 Edition 3 (ES3)  
specification. Now, I'm happy to report, the split is over.</i></p>
<p>The solution was to work together:</p>
<ul>
<li>ECMAScript 4 was renamed to ES5</li>
<li>ES5 should be an incremental upgrade of ECMAScript 3.</li>
<li>Features of ECMAScript 4 should be picked up in later versions.</li>
<li>TC39 should develop a new major release, bigger in scope than ES5.</li>
</ul>
<p>The planned new release (ES6) was codenamed "Harmony" (Because of the split it created?).</p>
<p>ES5 was a huge success. It was released in 2009, and all major browsers (including Internet Explorer) were fully
compliant by July 2013:</p>

<div class="table-responsive-wrapper"><table class="browserref notranslate">

<p>ES6 was also a huge success. It was released in 2015, and all major browsers were fully compliant by March  2017:</p>
