<h1>C <span class="color_h1">Introduction</span></h1>


<hr>


<h2>What is C?</h2>
<p>C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in 1972.</p>
<p>It is popular because it is fast, widely supported, and helps you understand how programs work "under the hood".</p>
<p>The main reason for its popularity is because it is a fundamental language in the field of computer science.</p>
<p>C is closely connected to UNIX, because much of UNIX was written in C.</p>

<h2>What is C used for?</h2>
<p>C is often used to create programs that need to run fast and work closely with the computer.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Operating systems, such as parts of Windows, Linux, and macOS</li>
  <li>Programs inside devices like cars, TVs, and home electronics</li>
  <li>Software that needs to be fast, including databases and system tools</li>
  <li>Game engines and programs that handle graphics</li>
  <li>Core libraries that other programming languages rely on</li>
</ul>

<div class="w3-panel ws-note">
<p><b>For curious learners:</b>
C has different language standards (like C90, C99, C11, C17, and newer versions). This tutorial focuses on modern, widely supported C, and we point out important differences when it matters.</p>

<h2>Why Learn C?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>It is one of the most widely used programming languages</li>
  <li>If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar</li>
  <li>It helps you understand memory, performance, and how computers handle data</li>
  <li>C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Difference between C and C++</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../cpp/default.html">C++</a> was developed as an extension of C, and the syntax is often similar</li>
  <li>C is mainly a procedural language (you build programs with functions)</li>
  <li>C++ supports classes and objects (often used for object-oriented programming)</li>
</ul>

<div class="w3-panel ws-note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> C can still organize data using <strong>structures</strong>, and you can build large programs in C too. C++ just offers additional features (like classes) on top.</p>
</div>

<h2>C Example</h2>
<p>C is often used in everyday programming tasks, like showing a message to a user:</p>

<div class="w3-example">
<h3>Example</h3>
<div class="w3-code notranslate javaHigh">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br><br>int main() {<br>&nbsp; char name[] = &quot;John&quot;;<br>&nbsp; 
  printf(&quot;Hello %s&quot;, name);<br>&nbsp; return 0;<br>}</div>


<p>Result:</p>
<div class="notranslate w3-black w3-padding">
  <code>Hello John</code>
</div>


</div>

<h2>Get Started</h2>
<p>Now let's get you started!</p>
<p>This tutorial will teach you the basics of C, step by step.</p>
<p>You will learn how to write C programs, understand what the code means, and build small projects along the way.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to have any prior programming experience.</p>
